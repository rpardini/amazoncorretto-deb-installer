# Info for final users

This is far from production ready!
Use these packages at your own risk.

## For Ubuntu:

```bash
# only use this on test/throwaway machines as of March/2019, until we get more testing done
sudo add-apt-repository --yes ppa:rpardini/amazoncorretto
sudo apt-get update
# install AdoptOpenJDK (full JDK) 8 with Hotspot and (via recommends) set it as the system default
# you can replace 8 with 11.
sudo apt-get install amazoncorretto-8-installer 
```

```bash
# also available are separate packages for some <version>-<JDK/JRE>-<JVM> combinations,
# to get a complete listing use:  
sudo apt-cache search amazoncorretto
```

## For Debian:

```bash
# update and install support for https:// sources if not already installed
[[ ! -f /usr/lib/apt/methods/https ]] && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https
# add my key to trusted APT keys 
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys A66C5D02
# add the package repo to sources 
echo 'deb https://rpardini.github.io/amazoncorretto-deb-installer stable main' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rpardini-amazoncorretto.list
